# Introduction

Linguistics is the scientific study of language and its structure, including the sounds, words, grammar, and meanings used in communication between people. Linguists examine language from different angles, analyzing its form (phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax), meaning (semantics, pragmatics), and use (sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics). They also investigate how languages change over time, how they are acquired by individuals, and how they are processed and understood by speakers and listeners. The field of linguistics encompasses a wide range of sub-disciplines and approaches, including theoretical, descriptive, and applied linguistics, as well as interdisciplinary fields such as computational linguistics and neurolinguistics. Linguistics has important applications in areas such as language teaching, speech therapy, translation, and natural language processing in computers.

## Rome in England from 55 BC to 410 AD(500Years)

By the 1st century AD, Roman Empire
governed all of the Italian peninsula, Romania,
Switzerland, England, France, and most of the
Mediterranean region as well as parts of North
Africa.

### Latin
Language:
 
* Romans force language change in many ways, but primarily through forcing merchants to do all their trade in Latin.
*	 Soon after infiltrating the commerce, they force the use of Latin in government.
* Next, they force the use of Latin in Religion and education.

## The Germanic Invasion
The Roman Empire left England for several reasons. One of the main reasons was that they were facing attacks from **barbarians** in other parts of Europe, which put a lot of pressure on their resources and made it hard to control their territories, including England. At the same time, the Roman economy was struggling and political instability was making it difficult to hold on to faraway lands like England. So, around 410 AD, the Roman authorities decided to withdraw their troops from England and focus more on defending the center of power. This decision was due to a combination of economic, military, and political factors that made it hard to keep control over distant territories while facing threats from external enemies.

### Who we're these barbarians
The term "barbarian" was used by the Romans to refer to anyone who did not speak Latin or Greek and who had a different culture or way of life than the Romans. However, it is important to note that this term is now considered outdated and derogatory.

The later years of the Roman Empire, Germanic tribes were one of the main groups of people who invaded and put pressure on the empire's borders. These tribes included the Visigoths, Vandals, Saxons, Franks, and Burgundians, among others. 


###  Romans Left England
When the Romans begin to
leave England, other groups
begin to invade. They were
not as concerned with
maintaining a language,
so the use of Latin as the
language of commerce,
government, religion and
education remained.
